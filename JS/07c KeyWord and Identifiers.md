Sure! Here's a short and clear explanation of **keywords** and **identifiers** in JavaScript:

---

## 🔑 Keywords

* **Keywords** are **reserved words** that have special meaning in JavaScript.
* You **cannot** use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers.

### ✅ Examples:

```javascript
let, const, var, if, else, for, while, function, return, class, new, this, try, catch
```

Example:

```javascript
let age = 25; // ✅ 'let' is a keyword used to declare a variable
```

🚫 You cannot do this:

```javascript
let if = 10; // ❌ Error! 'if' is a keyword
```

## 🆔 Identifiers

* **Identifiers** are the **names** you give to variables, functions, classes, etc.
* They are **created by you**, the programmer.

### ✅ Rules for Identifiers:

* Can contain letters, digits, `$`, and `_`
* **Cannot start with a digit**
* **Cannot be a keyword**
* Case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different)

### ✅ Examples:

```javascript
let studentName = "Alice";
function calculateTotal() { }
let $amount = 100;
let _privateVar = true;
```
