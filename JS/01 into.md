### JavaScript in 5 key points:

1. **Client-Side Scripting**: JavaScript runs in the browser to create dynamic, interactive web pages.
2. **Core Web Technology**: It works alongside HTML and CSS as one of the foundational technologies of the web.
3. **Event-Driven and Asynchronous**: JavaScript can respond to user actions (like clicks) and handle tasks without blocking the page.
4. **Cross-Platform**: It works across all major browsers and devices, ensuring broad compatibility.
5. **Also Used on Servers**: With environments like Node.js, JavaScript can run on servers, making it a full-stack language.
