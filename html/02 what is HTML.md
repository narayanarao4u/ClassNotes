### **What is HTML (HyperText Markup Language)?**

HTML, which stands for **HyperText Markup Language**, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It is not a programming language but a **markup language**, meaning it is designed to label or "mark up" content so that web browsers can interpret and display it correctly. 

In simpler terms, HTML provides the **framework** or **skeleton** for a webpage. Each element or piece of content (text, images, links, etc.) is enclosed within HTML tags, which define how it should be displayed on the page. 

The term "**HyperText**" refers to the ability to link pages and navigate between them using hyperlinks, while **"Markup Language"** refers to the tags or markers that label different pieces of content. HTML works alongside CSS and JavaScript to create fully functioning, interactive web pages.

### **Role of HTML in Defining the Structure of Web Pages**

HTML plays a foundational role in structuring web pages by organizing content into meaningful sections and elements. This structure helps both browsers and users understand what each part of the page is meant to do. Here's how HTML defines the structure:

1. **Basic Page Structure**:
   - Every HTML document starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which tells the browser the document is written in HTML5.
   - The main structure includes an opening and closing `<html>` tag, which encompasses the entire content of the page.

2. **Head Section**:
   - Inside the `<head>` section, you define important metadata about the webpage, like the title (`<title>`) that appears in the browser tab, as well as links to external resources like stylesheets or scripts.
   - The `<meta>` tag is used to define metadata such as character encoding, which is vital for proper text display.

3. **Body Section**:
   - The content visible on the page goes inside the `<body>` tag. This is where you structure the various parts of your webpage, using HTML tags like:
     - **Headings** (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create titles and subtitles, structuring the content hierarchy.
     - **Paragraphs** (`<p>`) to define blocks of text.
     - **Links** (`<a>`) to navigate between pages.
     - **Images** (`<img>`) to embed visual content.
     - **Lists** (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) for creating ordered and unordered lists.

4. **Semantic Structure**:
   - HTML also allows for **semantic elements** that define the purpose of sections in the document, making the structure more meaningful and accessible. For example:
     - **<header>** for the top section of the page, often containing navigation and branding.
     - **<nav>** for navigation links.
     - **<article>** for independent content items like blog posts.
     - **<section>** for grouping content.
     - **<footer>** for the bottom part of the page.

5. **Hyperlinks and Multimedia**:
   - One of HTML's key features is its ability to create **hyperlinks** using the `<a>` tag, which allows users to navigate between different pages or sections within the same page.
   - HTML also supports embedding multimedia content, such as images (`<img>`), videos (`<video>`), and audio (`<audio>`), providing a richer user experience.

6. **Hierarchy and Accessibility**:
   - HTML allows you to build a **content hierarchy**, ensuring that the most important information (like headings and main content) is clear to both users and search engines.
   - It also helps with **accessibility** by using semantic tags and attributes, enabling screen readers to interpret the content more easily for users with disabilities.

### **In Summary**:
HTML is the foundation of every web page, defining the **structure and organization** of content. It provides the essential building blocks that web browsers use to render websites, ensuring that users can navigate, read, and interact with information on the web.
