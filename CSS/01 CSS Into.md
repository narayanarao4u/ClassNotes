# CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
---
## Here are 5 important points about an introduction to CSS:

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to define the presentation and layout of web pages written in HTML.  


- It separates content from design, allowing developers to control colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning independently of the HTML structure.  

- CSS rules consist of selectors that target HTML elements and declarations that specify style properties and their values.  

- The CSS box model is a core concept that describes how elements are structured with content, padding, borders, and margins to control spacing and layout. 

- CSS enables responsive design, adapting the appearance of web pages to different devices and screen sizes.
